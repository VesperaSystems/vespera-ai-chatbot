## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### `DocumentEditorWithSuggestions`

```typescript
interface DocumentEditorWithSuggestionsProps {
  content: string;
  suggestions: Suggestion[];
  onContentChange: (content: string) => void;
  onSuggestionAction: (
    suggestionId: string,
    action: "accept" | "reject"
  ) => void;
  onAddComment: (suggestionId: string, comment: string) => void;
  isReadOnly?: boolean;
}
```

#### `Suggestion` Interface

```typescript
interface Suggestion {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  originalText: string;
  recommendedText: string;
  comment: string;
  position: {
    start: number;
    end: number;
  };
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected";
}
```

### ProseMirror Integration

- Custom marks for suggestion status

### Export Functionality

The export system creates DOCX files with:

- Original text with strikethrough for deletions
- New text in color for insertions
- Comments embedded in the document
- Status tracking for each change
