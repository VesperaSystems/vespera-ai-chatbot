# Download Link Test

## ✅ **Download Functionality Implementation Complete**

I've successfully implemented the download functionality for edited DOCX files. Here's what has been added:

### 🔧 **New API Endpoint**

**File**: `app/api/download/edited-document/route.ts`

- **Security**: Validates file paths are within temp directory
- **File Serving**: Serves DOCX files with proper headers
- **Cleanup**: Automatically deletes temporary files after download
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 📋 **Updated Edit Document Tool**

**File**: `lib/ai/tools/edit-document.ts`

- **Download URL Generation**: Creates secure download links

- **Console Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging
- **Return Values**: Includes download URL and filename

### 🚀 **How It Works**
