# Test Recent Files Functionality

## Steps to Test:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the file manager
3. Upload a few test files
4. Click on the "Recent" folder in the sidebar
5. Verify that the last 10 uploaded files are displayed

## Expected Behavior:

- The "Recent" folder should show the last 10 files that were uploaded
- Files should be ordered by creation date (newest first)
- The file count badge should show the correct number of recent files
- Files should be filterable by search query

## Changes Made:

1. **API Endpoint (`/api/files/structure`)**:

   - Modified the recent files query to show last 10 uploaded files instead of accessed files
   - Uses `files.createdAt` for ordering and `files` table directly

2. **FileManagerProvider**:

   - Added metadata properties `_isRecent` and `_isShared` to identify file types
   - Updated filtering logic to use metadata instead of checking properties
   - Added debugging logs to track file filtering

3. **TreeView**:
   - Updated file counting logic to use metadata properties
   - Fixed root folder counting to only count files directly in root

## Files Modified:

- `app/(chat)/api/files/structure/route.ts`
- `components/file-manager/FileManagerProvider.tsx`
- `components/file-manager/TreeView.tsx`
